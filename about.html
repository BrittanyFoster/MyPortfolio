    <!--Biography-->
    <div>
      <div class="biocontent-bold">Growing up in Phoenix,</div>
      <div class="biocontent">I equally enjoyed being outside in the Arizona sunshine or inside curled up with a book. I enjoyed art in all forms: literature, performing arts, and visual design.</div>

<div class="biocontent">I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from Arizona State University in 2005 and studied abroad in Spain that summer. After graduating, I realized then was the perfect time to experience living in Southern California, which had been on my bucket list for awhile. Hollywood offered afternoon trips to the beach, artistic culture, and the potential to see what career paths were out there. I moved a few weeks later, one of the best decisions I ever made for myself.</div>

      <div class="biocontent">I went on auditions, took evening dance classes, interned for Red Hen Press, and worked at Deluxe Film Production Studios. The excitement of exploring this new found freedom while I sought out the beginning of my career path was exhilarating. For the first time in my life, I took opportunities as they came.</div>

<div class="biocontent">I still had a passion for literature but since there were no major book publishing companies in Los Angeles, I went a different route. I decided that becoming an English teacher would fulfill two desires, a structured and goal driven work schedule, with a creative spark to help students discover their passion for language arts.</div>


      	<div class="biocontent">I completed a Master of Arts degree in Educational Leadership from North Central University. After eight years of teaching English, I was ready for the next challenge.</div>
     		<div class="biocontent">In 2015, I started my new path as a corporate sales trainer at Dish Network. When coming into the company, the role was more difficult than I expected. Training materials were disjointed, outdated, and made little sense to someone new coming into the role who needed to teach the material. Most days, the lack of quality training materials left me feeling frustrated. As I got further into the role, I was determined not to let new trainers experience what I had. Because of my background in education, I had a strong basis for creating teaching materials and knew how to begin fixing the problem.</div>
        <div class="biocontent">I reached out to the Instruction/UX Design team in Denver and discovered the Learning Manager was experiencing similar frustrations on her end. She and I worked together to create an outline and structure for consistency in the training materials so they could be well facilitated.</div>

        <div class="biocontent-bold">The initiative and creative ideas I showed during those months was noticed.</div>
        <div class="biocontent">The manager of the National Training team approached me a little over a year after I started with the company and asked if I would consider applying for his team to train sales trainers.</div>
        <div class="biocontent">As I grew in my new role as a National Trainer, I was still passionate to learn about the Learning & Design Team. One of the designers noticed my interest and suggested Bloc, an 8 month intensive UX Design program, where many designers in the department learned their skills. In December 2018, I enrolled in Bloc’s Designer track and started back to school, this time with a completely different focus than before.</div>
        <div class="biocontent-bold">UX Design blends all of my passions and personality traits into one. Self driven, independent, artistic, and passionate about designing and creating content.</div>
        <div class="biocontent">I’ve learned that simply putting myself out there and going after what I really want is the first major step in getting where I want to be. With the connections I’ve already made in UX Design, I’m ready to jump right in.</div>
