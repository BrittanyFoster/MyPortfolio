Getting ideas from both the applicant and employer will tighten the bond and connect like minded individuals quicker.

            <p class="case-study-content">Using a strong Hero image conveyed action. Originally, I used a desktop image which wasn't interesting enough, then a lighted background which didn't display any action. The Hero image I settled on shows applicants searching for a job while the second image shows the action of a person driving to and from work. Both convey action and growth from using the product without being too literal.</p><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">I added professional images to break up the text information and improve the quality of the design. Then, I took ideas from existing cloud services to come up with a platform of my own. I wanted all users to be able to easily navigate the site and but also have the feel of a top of the line, elite platform. The foundation of the dashboard design was based on Google Drive. I took what I liked and added my own design to give the site its own distinct look and feel.</p><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">I used a grid to make each element the exact same spacing. The end result appeared much cleaner and I added drop shadows to make boxes and images float on the pages.</p>

            <p class="case-study-content">Developing a unique logo and a brand was a challenge. At first I went too literal with the idea of networking and connecting with pretty basic logo designs. My creativity was lacking because the ideas were too literal and the brand develoment was not coming along.</p><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">A user suggested I get away from literal ideas and come up with abstract ones like Apple computers using an Apple logo. I started developing fruit logos and came up with LimeLite, which was a short lived idea I had for a previous project. The logo idea and branding matched the message of the company, which is all about getting yourself seen in the employment field. Once I had this "fruitful" idea, the creative juices started to flow.</p><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">The brand is geared more toward the younger generation. Since LinkedIn has a more professional adult vibe, I wanted to go a different route. The bright colors and young vibe of the logo matched with the intended audience of the younger generation. The brand can still be utilized by older generations, but has a light hearted, comtemporary vibe to intrigue the up and coming one.</p>

          <div class="half-page">

            <p class="case-study-content">The idea behind LimeLite started with a challenge of applicants to be seen in the working world, especially when transitioning into a new field. Most employers want to see several years of experience in the field, and few are willing to give an individual with no experience a chance. With this innovative platform, an applicant can highlight their skills, proactively reach out to employers, and make a strong impression before sitting down for an interview.<br>
            <br>LinkedIn was created with a similar idea, to make connections and network in the workforce especially when most applicants are online.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="half-page">
            <p class="case-study-content">Creating a colorful design and concept brought the site to life. The idea and brand became distinctly different and marketable.<br></br>
            Being on a time crunch set my mind into overdrive and I was able to complete each step of the process quickly. The more projects I complete, I realize I am not running short on creative ideas. The idea of LimeLite didn't come together for the last project but I was able to bring that idea into this project with a better platform.</p>
