                <p class="summary-content">Cloud organization and storage is on the rise and there is unlimited potential for what it can become. Google Drive and Drop Box are some of the leading companies but there are still unexplored areas cloud storage can thrive. FLYt targets users on the go who share and store a lot of information quickly. Users can save, organize, and create content, upload files, share items and connect with other users for real time collaboration. In a rapidly changing world, FLYt is taking off to new possibilities.</p>

            <p class="case-study-content">The client initially mentioned that they see potential in cloud storage services to be an enhanced version of what already exists.</p><br><br>
            <ol class="case-study-content-ol">
                <li>1. Staying connected</li>
                <li>2. Expanding offline opportunities</li>
                <li>3. Enhancing free services</li>
                <li>4. Simplifying ways to access information</li>
                <li>5. Resetting Password</li>
                <li>6. Trusting in the cloud to store personal information</li>
            </ol><br><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">Overall, the client believes there are a lot of interesting and compelling features they could put into this new application, but does not yet have a clear vision, including a name or brand. The client isn’t sure if this could be a web app for desktop browsers, usable on mobile devices or both. They don’t have a target audience in mind and need a designer’s thoughts on the opportunity that plays to core strengths and brings it to the market.</p>

            <div class="case-study-title">Solution</div>
            <p class="case-study-content">FLYt simplifies the process of saving, creating, and organizing content into a platform that is easy for any user to navigate.</p>
            <ol class="case-study-content-ol">
                <li>1. As many technologies are integrating, the user wants to feel that platforms are all connected, without having to exit out of one platform to get to another. There are currently limitations sharing via social media platforms, but with FLYt users will now stay connected at all times.</li>
                <li>2. One of user’s biggest pain points is not being able to work offline when on the go. FLYt will allow the user to work offline and temporarily save content until back online.</li>
                <li>3. An area of opportunity is giving more free storage for users, especially for college students and those just starting their career. FLYt’s solution is to start users out with 20 GB before upgrading to the next package.</li>
                <li>4. FLYt users can access their stored information from any device in any format.</li>
                <li>5. The process of resetting a password is tedious and instead of just providing the user with the original password, they are usually required to change it. With FLYt’s improved process, the user can retrieve their information quickly.</li>
                <li>6. FLYt’s platform allows users to trust their information will be safe.</li>

                64.7% of the users surveyed use the site for both personal and business needs and their feedback provided insight into what a user actually wants with a cloud storage service. I focused on three types of users: a college student and two working professionals, a man and a woman who are balancing personal and business life. For example, a Sales Consultant who travels a significant amount of time for the job needs a quick and reliable way to connect with his team while on the go.

The design at the end looked cleaner and more professional. Also all buttons needed to click toward something to solve the user’s needs. It needed to be easy to use, some steps being eliminated and some added.</p>

            <p class="case-study-content">My original background screens were too colorful which overpowered the text and information on the page. Once I applied professional visuals, the creative design started to come together. I used icons from Sketch App Sources and visuals from Unsplash.com to enhance the appearance of the page. I enhanced the package features section with a grid and added details like rounding the edges of rectangles and was deliberate with the size, style, and amount of text.</p><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">I added professional images to break up the text information and improve the quality of the design. Then, I took ideas from existing cloud services to come up with a platform of my own. I wanted all users to be able to easily navigate the site and but also have the feel of a top of the line, elite platform. The foundation of the dashboard design was based on Google Drive. I took what I liked and added my own design to give the site its own distinct look and feel.</p><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">I wanted to add colors into the design without it being overwhelming. I am also a huge fan of themes and I liked using the Flight theme throughout the site. Terms such as FLYt Deck, FLYt Storage, Lounge Access, and names for types of documents like FLYt Demo and FLYt Grid enhanced the brand and theme and brought it altogether.</p>

            <p class="case-study-content">I developed an idea of using a hummingbird since they move so fast and effortlessly in the air. It seemed to be a perfect analogy for a cloud service. Because the bird was looking down, it appeared to be looking at the information beneath it. Also being an outline of a bird, I could fill in the logo with one color. The final logo looked sharp and sophisticated.</p><br>
            <p class="case-study-content">I used a bright, bluish purple with a 20% opacity for the navigation bar. Simplifying the website colors allowed for a variety of other colors to pop out, like a champagne gold in the background images. The name Flyt came to me pretty quickly, but then I capitalized more letters to create FLYt with a focus on the word FLY. Adding the last letter as a lower case became a stylistic choice used on other text throughout the site.</p>

The information is now easier for the reader to digest and allows them to click to the next page to learn more about that particular feature. <br></br>A few users suggested that I organize the package information in the form of a grid to make it easier to understand what each package offers. I had a variety of colors for the different packages, but in the end used one solid purple for simplicity.</p>

          <div class="half-page">

            <p class="case-study-content">Receiving user feedback was the most helpful tool in improving my design. Each person offered new insight and I usually agreed with what they were saying. I learned that giving images and text more space to breathe is one of the most significant aspects of web design. The background should support the information, not overwhelm it. Simplifying colors, text, images, and spacing brought it altogether.<br>
            <br>What did not work was trying to guess what the website design should look like and relying solely on my own knowledge to build it. I knew it didn’t look great at first but also didn’t have the tools like Unsplash.com and Sketch App sources to implement images.</p>
          </div>
            <div class="half-page">
            <p class="case-study-content">I learned that I have a lot of the skills to be a UX Designer, it was just a matter of putting it into a new format. I have a lot of creative ideas and I know I can do even better in the next project.<br></br>
            In the end, I was highly pleased with how the site turned out. I thought it not only met the client’s initial expectations, but gave them a unique creative brand and enticing visual design. It focused on fixing the customer's pain points and I believe the client would be satisfied with the end result and will now be able to move forward to launch their cloud platform.</p>
